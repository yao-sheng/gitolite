**Support**

[This](http://sitaramc.github.com/gitolite/support.html) is the main support page.

The rest of this info is specific to github users, etc.

  * Please **don't** send me messages via github's "issues" system, linkedin comments/discussion, stackoverflow questions, google+ "streams", and any other Web 3.0 "coolness".
  * Please **don't** send me pull requests via github.  Instead, send me an email saying what URL and what branch to pull.

Email addresses and contact info are [here](http://sitaramc.github.com/gitolite/index.html#contact_and_license_)

Support requests that indicate insufficient reading or understanding of the enormous amount of documentation that comes with gitolite will be answered only if time permits.  This applies especially to **ssh issues**.
