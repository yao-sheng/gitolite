# Welcome to the gitolite wiki!!

**Gitolite allows you to host Git repositories easily and securely.**

Please start reading [here](https://github.com/sitaramc/gitolite#readme) to learn about gitolite.

**IMPORTANT** update, Nov 2 2014: I do not support/endorse "tip4commit.com" and have asked them to remove all mention of my name or the name gitolite from their site.  See https://github.com/tip4commit/tip4commit/issues/173.  If you really want to contribute, please see the donation section below (TLDR: I don't want anything; I just make some suggestions of deserving FOSS projects you can donate to instead of donating to me!)

**CONTACTING ME**

Click [here](http://sitaramc.github.com/gitolite/index.html#contact) for information about contacting me, the mailing list, and IRC channel.  **Unless you are reporting what you think is a security issue, I prefer you send to the mailing list, not to me directly**.

Please **DO NOT** send me messages via github's "issues" system, linkedin comments/discussion, stackoverflow questions, google+, and any other Web 3.0 "coolness".  (The issues system does have an email interface, but it is not a substitute for email.  I can't cc anyone else when I want to, for instance.  Well I can, but any response the original requester then makes using the website will not get cc-d to the person I cc-d).

**SENDING ME PATCHES**

Please send me patches **via email**, not as github pull requests.  Again, if you think it's a security issue, send it directly to my gmail address, but otherwise please send  it to the mailing list, so others can see it and comment on it.

The preferred format is the files created by git-format-patch, as attachments.  However, if your repo has a public clone URL, you can make a new branch just for this fix, and send the repo URL and branch name to the mailing list.

(If you do send me a github pull request, I may take it if it's a trivial patch, but otherwise I'll ask you to close the pull request, then read this URL for how to send me the patch.)

**GPG KEY**

My gpg key (should be available at least from pgp.mit.edu keyserver, probably most others as well):

**Donations**

*Disclaimer: this is my personal opinion and does not necessarily reflect that of my employer.  The disclaimer applies especially strongly to para 3 below*.

I've had people ask me how they can donate to gitolite.  The first part of the answer is that there is no need.  I work for TCS, which is a large IT services firm, and they support my efforts in this and always have.

The second part of the answer is that if you feel the need to donate, please donate to either the [VIM project](http://www.vim.org/sponsor/index.php) or the [Perl Foundation](http://donate.perlfoundation.org/), both of which I consider indispensable to my work.

I have been using open source since 1995, both personally and at work, and until now have never actually given back in any significant way other than evangelism.  Thus the third part of the answer is that you can actually donate to *any* FOSS project whose primary target OS is a free OS (i.e., projects whose primary target is Windows or Mac or indeed any proprietary OS, don't qualify) that you think makes a big difference in your life, and, I will consider myself thanked adequately :-)
