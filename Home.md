**Support**

[This](http://sitaramc.github.com/gitolite/support.html) is the main support page.

The rest of this info is specific to github users, etc.

  * Please **don't** send me messages via github's "issues" system, linkedin comments/discussion, stackoverflow questions, google+ "streams", and any other Web 3.0 "coolness".
  * Please **don't** send me pull requests via github.  Instead, send me an email saying what URL and what branch to pull.

Email addresses and contact info are [here](http://sitaramc.github.com/gitolite/index.html#contact_and_license_)

Support requests that indicate insufficient reading or understanding of the enormous amount of documentation that comes with gitolite will be answered only if time permits.  This applies especially to **ssh issues**.

**Donations**

*Disclaimer: this is my personal opinion and does not necessarily reflect that of my employer.  The disclaimer applies especially strongly to para 3 below*.

I've had people ask me how they can donate to gitolite.  The first part of the answer is that there is no need.  I work for TCS, which is a large IT services firm, and they support my efforts in this and always have.

The second part of the answer is that if you feel the need to donate, please donate to either the [VIM project](http://www.vim.org/sponsor/index.php) or the [Perl Foundation](http://donate.perlfoundation.org/), both of which I consider indispensable to my work.

I have used open source for almost 17 years now, both personally and at work, and until now have never actually given back in any significant way other than evangelism.  Thus the third part of the answer is that you can actually donate to *any* FOSS project (other than projects that use Mono) that you think makes a big difference in your life, and, I will consider myself thanked adequately :-)
