# Welcome to the gitolite wiki!!

**Gitolite allows you to host Git repositories easily and securely.**

Please start reading [here](https://github.com/sitaramc/gitolite#readme) to learn about gitolite.

**CONTACTING ME**

Click [here](http://sitaramc.github.com/gitolite/index.html#contact) for information about contacting me, the mailing list, and IRC channel.

Please **DO NOT** send me messages via github's "issues" system, linkedin comments/discussion, stackoverflow questions, google+ "streams", and any other Web 3.0 "coolness".  (The issues system does have an email interface, but it is not a substitute for email.  I can't cc anyone else when I want to, for instance.  Well I can, but any response the original requester then makes using the website will not get cc-d to the person I cc-d).

Please **DO NOT** send me pull requests via github.  Instead, send me an email saying what URL and what branch to pull.  (The pull system forces a --no-ff even if the merge is at the top of my branch and doesn't need one.  It also gives me no chance to fix up minor typos, add any more text to the commit message, etc.  I can do that afterward, but this forces a "push -f" or a trivial "typofix" commit).

**GPG KEY**

My gpg key (should be available at least from pgp.mit.edu keyserver, probably most others as well):

**Donations**

*Disclaimer: this is my personal opinion and does not necessarily reflect that of my employer.  The disclaimer applies especially strongly to para 3 below*.

I've had people ask me how they can donate to gitolite.  The first part of the answer is that there is no need.  I work for TCS, which is a large IT services firm, and they support my efforts in this and always have. (Wait till they see your "efforts" as a waste of time, then you will be wishing you had opened a donation portal -_- )

The second part of the answer is that if you feel the need to donate, please donate to either the [VIM project](http://www.vim.org/sponsor/index.php) or the [Perl Foundation](http://donate.perlfoundation.org/), both of which I consider indispensable to my work.

I have used open source for almost 17 years now, both personally and at work, and until now have never actually given back in any significant way other than evangelism.  Thus the third part of the answer is that you can actually donate to *any* FOSS project (other than projects that use Mono) that you think makes a big difference in your life, and, I will consider myself thanked adequately :-)
