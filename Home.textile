Welcome to the gitolite wiki!

bq. _Side note: please don't expect responses if you use github's messaging interface to contact me.  I prefer email.  See bottom of this page for more on this._

**Gitolite allows you to host Git repositories easily and securely.**

Please start with the "README":http://github.com/sitaramc/gitolite/blob/pu/README.mkd to learn about gitolite

----

**Contacting me:**

If you need anything, let me know either on irc (#git on freenode -- but be aware I live in UTC+0530) or via email:

  * to sitaramc@gmail.com if it's a minor issue you don't want to bother others with (although I might choose to add the group in my reply if I think others will benefit)
  * to gitolite@googlegroups.com directly.

You don't have to subscribe, but if you wish to, I think sending an email to gitolite+subscribe@googlegroups.com will add you.

**Please do NOT use github's messaging interface to contact me.  Or rather, don't expect me to respond if you do.**

Much as I love github the issues/messaging interface sucks; except for keeping track of "closed" versus "open" it adds no value, and even if it did have the dozens of fields that bugzilla-type systems have, gitolite is too small a project for that sort of complexity.

There are other reasons I hate it:
  * it lives in its own world, not knowing or caring about the much more common "email" world
  * it breaks communications up; I can't cc someone else in something you and I are discussing
  * even if it could, it would still require that that someone else also be a github member
  * and finally, I have to log on separately to reply, which I find a pain
