Welcome to the gitolite wiki!

If you need anything, let me know:

* irc: #git on freenode (but be aware I live in UTC+0530)
* email: sitaramc@gmail.com
* mailing list: gitolite@googlegroups.com if you want a wider audience for your question/comment

Please do NOT use the issues database on github or send me a message via github.  Much as I love github the messaging interface sucks.

Send email to gitolite@googlegroups.com instead.  You don't have to subscribe, but if you wish to, I think sending an email to gitolite+subscribe@googlegroups.com will add you.
