Welcome to the gitolite wiki!

If you need anything, let me know:

  * irc: #git on freenode (but be aware I live in UTC+0530)
  * email: sitaramc@gmail.com
  * mailing list: gitolite@googlegroups.com if you want a wider audience for your question/comment

Please do NOT use the issues database on github or send me a message via github.

Send email:

  * to sitaramc@gmail.com if it's a minor issue you don't want to bother others with (although I might choose to add the group in my reply if I think others will benefit)
  * to gitolite@googlegroups.com directly.

You don't have to subscribe, but if you wish to, I think sending an email to gitolite+subscribe@googlegroups.com will add you.

(Much as I love github the issues/messaging interface sucks; except for keeping track of "closed" versus "open" it adds no value, and even if it did have the dozens of fields that bugzilla-type systems have, gitolite is too small a project for that sort of complexity.)
