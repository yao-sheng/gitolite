**Support**

You can reach me on irc (#git on freenode — but be aware I live in UTC+0530) or via email:

  * to sitaramc@gmail.com if it's a minor issue you don't want to bother others with (although I might choose to add the group in my reply if I think others will benefit)
  * to gitolite@googlegroups.com directly.  You don't have to subscribe, but if you wish to, I think sending an email to gitolite+subscribe@googlegroups.com will add you.

Please don't send me messages via github, linkedin, googlecode, google+, stackoverflow, and God knows what else.  Email me or it didn't happen.
