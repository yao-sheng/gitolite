Welcome to the gitolite wiki!

**Documentation**:  All documentation is available within the source repo, in markdown format.  If you want to read it *without* cloning the source repo, just hit "this link":http://github.com/sitaramc/gitolite/blob/pu/doc and read nicely HTML-ised versions of all the docs (automatic rendering of markdown to HTML courtesy github)

If you need anything, let me know either on irc (#git on freenode -- but be aware I live in UTC+0530) or via email:

  * to sitaramc@gmail.com if it's a minor issue you don't want to bother others with (although I might choose to add the group in my reply if I think others will benefit)
  * to gitolite@googlegroups.com directly.

You don't have to subscribe, but if you wish to, I think sending an email to gitolite+subscribe@googlegroups.com will add you.

(Much as I love github the issues/messaging interface sucks; except for keeping track of "closed" versus "open" it adds no value, and even if it did have the dozens of fields that bugzilla-type systems have, gitolite is too small a project for that sort of complexity.)
