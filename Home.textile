Welcome to the gitolite wiki!

----

**Gitolite allows you to host Git repositories easily and securely.**

Please start reading "here":http://github.com/sitaramc/gitolite#start to learn about gitolite

**Support**

You can reach me on irc (#git on freenode — but be aware I live in UTC+0530) or via email:

  * to sitaramc@gmail.com if it's a minor issue you don't want to bother others with (although I might choose to add the group in my reply if I think others will benefit)
  * to gitolite@googlegroups.com directly.  You don't have to subscribe, but if you wish to, I think sending an email to gitolite+subscribe@googlegroups.com will add you.

**Note 1**: support for ssh issues will be spotty; if you're installing gitolite, you're a system admin, like it or not, and you should learn ssh.  Support requests that indicate insufficient reading or understanding of "http://sitaramc.github.com/gitolite/doc/ssh-troubleshooting.html":http://sitaramc.github.com/gitolite/doc/ssh-troubleshooting.html (as well as all linked documents) will be answered only if time permits.

**Note 2**: Please don’t send me messages via github's "issues" system, linkedin comments/discussion, stackoverflow questions, google+ "streams", and any other Web 3.0 "coolness".  Also, please don't send me pull requests via github.  The only thing I will accept is an email saying what URL and what branch to pull.
