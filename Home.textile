Welcome to the gitolite wiki!

**Gitolite allows you to host Git repositories easily and securely.**

Please start reading "here":http://github.com/sitaramc/gitolite#start to learn about gitolite

**Support**

How **NOT** to reach me:

  * **don't** send me messages via github's "issues" system, linkedin comments/discussion, stackoverflow questions, google+ "streams", and any other Web 3.0 "coolness".
  * **don't** send me pull requests via github.

You **can** reach me as follows:

  * irc, #git on freenode.  But be aware I live in UTC+0530 (India).

  * email to sitaramc@gmail.com.  Best if it's a minor issue you don't want to bother others with.  However, **please understand** that I may choose to add the group in my reply if I think others can help you better or others will benefit from my reply, **unless** your email explicitly states that you don't want me to

  * email to gitolite@googlegroups.com directly.  You don't have to subscribe, but emails from non-subscribers may be delayed.  I think sending an email to gitolite+subscribe@googlegroups.com will add you, if you want to do that

About **pull requests**: you can send me an email saying what URL and what branch to pull.  As mentioned above I will not accept pull requests from github.

**Support for ssh issues** will be very spotty; if you're installing gitolite, you're a system admin, like it or not, and you should learn ssh.  Support requests that indicate insufficient reading or understanding of "http://sitaramc.github.com/gitolite/doc/ssh-troubleshooting.html":http://sitaramc.github.com/gitolite/doc/ssh-troubleshooting.html (as well as all linked documents) will be answered only if time permits.
