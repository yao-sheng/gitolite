Welcome to the gitolite wiki!

If you need anything, let me know either on irc (#git on freenode -- but be aware I live in UTC+0530) or via email:

  * to sitaramc@gmail.com if it's a minor issue you don't want to bother others with (although I might choose to add the group in my reply if I think others will benefit)
  * to gitolite@googlegroups.com directly.

You don't have to subscribe, but if you wish to, I think sending an email to gitolite+subscribe@googlegroups.com will add you.

(Much as I love github the issues/messaging interface sucks; except for keeping track of "closed" versus "open" it adds no value, and even if it did have the dozens of fields that bugzilla-type systems have, gitolite is too small a project for that sort of complexity.)
