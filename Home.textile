**Contacting me:**

If you need anything, let me know either on irc (#git on freenode -- but be aware I live in UTC+0530) or via email:

  * to sitaramc@gmail.com if it's a minor issue you don't want to bother others with (although I might choose to add the group in my reply if I think others will benefit)
  * to gitolite@googlegroups.com directly.

You don't have to subscribe, but if you wish to, I think sending an email to gitolite+subscribe@googlegroups.com will add you.

I prefer to do everything by email.  I believe github's messaging interface now "speaks" normal email well enough for issues and discussions but I'm not quite sure about pull requests yet.  If I don't reply to something you put here within a reasonable time, switch to email.
